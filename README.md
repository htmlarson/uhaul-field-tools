# uhaul-field-tools

Tools designed for iOS Shortcuts, allowing for more functionality that I wish existed.

## How to use these tools

Most of these tools are designed to be used in Apple's Shortcuts for iOS, and are usually designed to be run in Safari by "Sharing" the page with the extension. This allows for the JavaScript to run on the page, and get you a useful result back.

These tools are opinionated.

## The tools

| Name | What it does | More... |
| ---- | ------------ | :------ |
| Better Equipment Inventory | Interacting with the "Equipment Inventory" tool, this feature allows you to enter simply the number of equipment (i.e., DC<strong>1234</strong>K as simply <strong>1234</strong>) to match it against the list, allowing for *much faster* completion of inventory. | [Download](https://github.com/htmlarson/uhaul-field-tools/raw/main/QuiInventory/Quinventory.shortcut) |
| Quick Inventory Resolve | After completing equipment inventory, this allows you to sort thru the list<em>way more quickly,</em> by reducing it to what it should have been all along: what is "on rental" but is on lot, and needs to be checked in; what should be on the lot but isn't. The results are put in an iOS note. | Coming Soon |
| Add Multiple to Cycle Count | A straightforward way to add many parts to the cycle count at once | Coming Soon |
| Better Hitch Source Report | The classic hitch sourcing report with two main improvements: tracking links are now tapable, and you can now tap on the part number to find fit details and possible alternate part numbers. | Coming Soon |
| Hookup Photo | An opinionated tool is intended to stitch together two things: the hookup photo, and a photo of the equipmet number -- so they can be more easilly found later. This tool has helped my store stay at 100% hookup photo percentage. It can also save the photos to a specific photo album, so you can delete old photos faster.  | Coming Soon |
| Clear Level 1 List | For GM/AFM only, this allows you to click the "Clear Level 1" checkbox on all the rows if you're confident they've already been completed.  | Coming Soon |
